# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our TA, Alejandro Esquivel, and out Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona. Thanks to Garth's continual resource suggestions I have lots of those to list as well. Stack Overflow was frequently consulted, as well as Geeks for Geeks, Python Pool, Github Docs, cmdlinetips, pandas reference doc, and the tech website collective in general. Regarding investing I was frequently on the Investopedia and Wikipedia websites (I have to get myself over to that simple english version still!), barchart, ... and others. Also the GoogleFinance functionality. Finally, the main books I used during this project were Markiel's "A Random Walk Down Wall Street", McKinney's "Python for Data Analysis" and Kleppman's "Python Data Science Handbook".
