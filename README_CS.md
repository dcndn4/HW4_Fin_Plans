# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our TA, Alejandro Esquivel, and out Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona. Thanks to Garth's continual resource suggestions I have lots of those to list as well. Stack Overflow was frequently consulted, as well as Geeks for Geeks, Python Pool, Github Docs, cmdlinetips, pandas reference doc, and the tech website collective in general. Regarding API's I found useful nuggets on the Red Hat site,   Finally, some of the main books I used during this project were "Continuous API Management - Making the Right Decisions in an Evolving Landscape by Medjaoui, Wilde, Mitra and Amundsen and API's, A Strategy Guide by Jacobson, Brail and Woods.
